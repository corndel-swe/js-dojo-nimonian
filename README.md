# JS Dojo

Welcome to the dojo!

This repo has plenty of exercises to help you practise programming in
JavaScript.

## Getting started

1. Make sure your machine is set up according to the instructions with

   - [bash](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/bash/)
   - [vscode](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/vscode/)
   - [git](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/git/)
   - [node & npm](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/js/installation.html)

1. Clone the repository (i.e. download it), so you have a copy on your machine.

1. Once cloned, open a terminal in the project folder, and run

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   to install dependencies.

## Running tests

You can test exercises individually using commands like

```bash
npm run test:functions:01
npm run test:arrays:13
```

You can test all exercises on a particular topic with commands like

```bash
npm run test:functions
npm run test:arrays
```

or you can run all tests at once using

```bash
npm run test
```

## Tech docs

Make sure to consult the
[tech docs](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/js/variables.html) to help understand
the basics!

In particular, the **Foundations** and **Data and iteration** sections will be
extremely useful.
